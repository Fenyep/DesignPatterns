# SINGLETON

## Problème à résoudre :

- If an application is to be portable, it needs to encapsulate platform dependencies. 
- These "platforms" might include: windowing system, operating system, database, etc. 
- Too often, this encapsulation is not engineered in advance, and lots of *#ifdef* case statements with options for all currently supported platforms begin to procreate like rabbits throughout the code.
